## Description

This repository provides tools for modeling the production of antibodies using measures of Memory B Cell and plasmablasts concentrations, and sVNT titres for SARS-CoV-2, as outlined in "*Memory B cell proliferation drives differences in neutralising responses between ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines"* preprinted at XX.

## Installation

This repository is not a package, but the data and all functions necessary to run the code can loaded by running the "R/main.R" file.

## Usage

A guide on how to recreate the analysis in the preprint for "Memory B cell proliferation drives differences in neutralising responses between ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines" is given in `vignettes/workflow.Rmd`
